# hasch

A library to consistently crypto-hash [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) data structures on Clojure and ClojureScript, e.g. with SHA-1. Commutative data structures like maps and sets are not hashed in order as was the case with e.g. hashing a simple printed edn string, but have the same hash value independent of order. UTF-8 is supported for strings, symbols and keywords.
You can also create UUID5 (using SHA-1) from it. Alternatively you can use your own hash function.

Support for edn types on the JVM and JavaScript is complete except for tagged literals, which are supposed to create platform specific objects and cannot be supported (see below to do it anyway). The library is tested in cross-platform prototypes, but still very young, don't rely on it for strong consistency yet.

REMEMBER THAT BREAKING THE HASH FUNCTION PROBABLY BREAKS YOUR STORED DATA!

Having said that, you can extend the `IHashCoercion` protocol to your types and use free magic numbers -128<=x<=-115. If somebody else uses the same magic numbers for their type and the objects only differ in type hash collisions will happen.

*Support for some types on cljs might be missing. Please point out any flaws you find!*

# TODO
- Decide whether we implement protocols (IMap,...) or for concrete type (PersistentHashMap), depending on what can be considered edn at runtime (immutability?).
- Automate tests in js (with cljx?).
- Nested collections are hashed with the supplied hash-fn before they contribute to the hash-value. This allows to form a peristent data-structure tree by breaking out collection values, so you can rehash top-level collections without pulling the whole value in memory. This is not tested yet, a git-like store could be implemented, e.g. in [geschichte](https://github.com/ghubber/konserve). This should be useful to build durable indexes also. But it might proof to need runtime tweaking, e.g. depending on value size.
- Use test.check/double.check property based tests.
- Profile for performance.

## Usage

Include in your `project.clj` for Leiningen 2+ with:

~~~clojure
    [net.polyc0l0r/hash "0.1.0"]
~~~

Then you can access the major function through `hash.core`:

~~~clojure
    (use 'hasch.core)
    (edn-hash ["hello world" {:a 3.14} #{42} '(if true nil \f)])
    => (-104 -11 -108 -93 -66 119 -92 73 32 -75 -73 21 82 -31 -45 122 -31 115 27 -23)

    (uuid5 (edn-hash "hello world"))
    => #uuid "09c1649c-40c3-51cc-829c-dc781de2eda0"

    ;; or just use the convenience multi-arity uuid fn:
    (uuid) => #uuid "a27dfbb9-b69a-4f08-8df4-471464bfeb37"
    (uuid "hello world") => #uuid "09c1649c-40c3-51cc-829c-dc781de2eda0"
